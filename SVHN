# Neural Convolutional Network Classification on SVHN Dataset

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network to classify street view house numbers (SVHN) using the SVHN dataset. The goal is to predict the correct digit in house numbers based on image input using a deep learning model.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Build and train a neural network using the SVHN dataset.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
- Visualize the classification results.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras: for building and training the neural network model.
  - NumPy: for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib: for plotting predictions.
  - Scikit-learn: for data preprocessing and performance evaluation.

## 4. Dataset
The **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)** dataset contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View, each centered around a single digit. The dataset consists of:
- **Training Set**: 73,257 samples.
- **Testing Set**: 26,032 samples.
- Each image is 32x32 pixels and labeled with a digit from 0 to 9.

## 5. Implementation
The neural network is built with the following steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The SVHN dataset is loaded and normalized for better training performance.
2. **Neural Network Architecture**:
   - Input Layer: 32x32 image input.
   - Hidden Layers: Several convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers.
   - Output Layer: A softmax layer with 10 outputs (one for each digit class).
3. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 6. Results
The model achieved good accuracy on the test set. Below is an example of visualizing predictions:

## 7. Challenges Faced
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and reshaping images for optimal performance in the neural network.
- **Model Tuning**: Iterative fine-tuning of the architecture to improve accuracy.

## 8. Future Work
Areas for potential improvement include:
- Experimenting with deeper network architectures.
- Using data augmentation techniques.
- Applying transfer learning for faster, more accurate results.

## 9. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a neural network for the classification of street view house numbers. The results showcase the model's ability to generalize to new images with an acceptable level of accuracy, though there is room for future improvements.
